## About

### Description and Purpose

CrashPad is more than just a roommate finder- it's your key to finding a compatible, trustworthy, and reliable roommate. Whether you're a student looking for a dorm mate, a professional seeking shared housing, or someone new to the city searching for the right cohabitant, CrashPad simplifies the process. Find a roommate who shares your values, respects your boundaries, and makes your living situation comfortable and harmonious.

### Inspiration

Being a student you always try to find a way to cut cost and one of the major cost is rent. But finding a roommate is always a hassle. Inspiration was born out of a desire to simplify and enhance the roommate-finding process and make it more positive and fun experience.
